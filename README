Example for hosting the (horrible!) ActiveScript runtime in C++.
Does some of the painful stuff for you, like implementing IDispatch
without imposing COM on the rest of your application.

The classic way to do this was to have the IDL compiler generate dual
interfaces, but this only works if you like IDL & COM. Something
was needed to make this work (reasonably) painlessly in an otherwise
plain-old-C++ environment.

Enjoy. At least as much as you'll enjoy anything associated with the
ActiveScript runtime!
